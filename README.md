biblatex-lncs
=============

BiBLaTeX style for Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science

# Introduction

The code works with `biblatex 2.2` and it requires `biber 1.2` as backend. It
extends the standard `BiBTeX` model by an `acronym` entry.

## Usage

    \usepackage[backend=biber,
      style=lncs
    ]{biblatex}
